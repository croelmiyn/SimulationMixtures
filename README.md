# SimulationMixtures
codes and executables for the simulations of mixtures

The classes folder comprise the compiles .class files, which need to be executed as PlugIns for ImageJ 

The src folder contains the annotated source codes

The ImageJ plugins are as follows:
- Test_HydroCell_Circle_MultiCore: Computes the mean flow field generated by a single circular swimmer
- Simu_HydroCell_MultiCircle_MultiCore: Computes the mean flow field generated by a population of circular swimmers
- Simu_HydroCell_DensityDistrib_MultiCircle_varSize_MultiCore: Simulate the trajectories of a population of Brownian and sedimenting tracers in the static mean flow field generated by a population of circular swimmers.
- Analysis_HydroCell_RedrawMovie: Draws the movie of reconstructed microscopy images (assuming a Gaussian point spread function) of the above mentioned population of circular swimmers
