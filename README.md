# SimulationMixtures
codes and executables for the simulations of mixtures

The classes folder comprise the compiles .class files, which need to be executed as PlugIns for ImageJ \
For this, copy the content of this folder in a (e.g.) ''SimulationMixtures'' (the name does not matter) folder in the Plugin subfolder of the ImageJ root \
Refresh menus or restart ImageJ \
The simulations are ready to be run!

The src folder contains the annotated source codes

The ImageJ plugins are as follows:
- _Test_HydroCell_Circle_MultiCore_ \
  Computes the mean flow field generated by a single circular swimmer
- _Simu_HydroCell_MultiCircle_CorrectedRadDistrib_MultiCore_ \
  Computes the mean flow field generated by a population of circular swimmers
- _Simu_HydroCell_DensityDistrib_MultiCircle_varSize_CorrectedRadDistrib_MultiCore_ \
  Simulates the trajectories of a population of Brownian and sedimenting tracers in the static mean flow field generated by a population of circular swimmers.
- _Analysis_HydroCell_RedrawMovie_ \
  Draws the movie of reconstructed microscopy images (assuming a Gaussian point spread function) of the above mentioned population of circular swimmers 

The codes are fully parallelized

See the source code, and/or the paper for a full description of the variables

Replacement of 

- _Simu_HydroCell_MultiCircle_MultiCore_ \
- _Simu_HydroCell_DensityDistrib_MultiCircle_varSize_MultiCore_ \

by

- _Simu_HydroCell_MultiCircle_CorrectedRadDistrib_MultiCore_ \
- _Simu_HydroCell_DensityDistrib_MultiCircle_varSize_CorrectedRadDistrib_MultiCore_ \

To correct for mistake in the distribution of circular radii
